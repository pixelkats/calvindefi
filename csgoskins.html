<h2>How to hedge against Bitcoin crash with CSGO Skins</h2>
<p>You’re probably laughing at the title, but yes I’m serious. CSGO Skins can be a good hedge against a potential Bitcoin crash for a few different key reasons.

  <h3>First up, why not just buy stablecoins?</h3>
<p>Read: <a href="https://medium.com/geekculture/usd-tether-the-largest-ticking-time-bomb-in-modern-financial-history-fabdac79238a">USD Tether — The Largest Ticking Time Bomb in Modern Financial History</a></p>

<h3>So why CSGO Skins exactly?</h3>
<p>CSGO Skins share a similar market to crypto. They can both be traded for crypto & cash relatively fast & they both have trusted marketplaces/exchanges. While they do share similar markets to crypto it doesn’t seem to share price action to crypto, making it a good hedge if you’re bearish on crypto. 
</p>
<p>Also CSGO Skins have generally shown good performance long term with price increases on most of the well liked skins.</p>

<h3>So where do I buy CSGO Skins?</h3>

<p>CSGO Skins can be bought on the official steam marketplace or on third party alternative sites. The official marketplace is pretty good but it has a pretty big downside, unfortunately there is no way to cash out your steam dollars for real money so the money earned can only be used to buy other skins or steam games for example.</p>

<p>The best way to buy CSGO Skins is on third party marketplaces like cs.deals or dmarket.com. These both accept crypto & have instant cash out. They also don’t require KYC like many other marketplaces/exchanges do.
</p>

<h3>What skins should I buy?</h3>
<p>I would recommend buying skins that you can easily buy/sell & has high demand.</p>
<p>Some examples: coming soon.</p>
